## Question 3 React Competency Test
Build a react app that calls an api and renders a random beer. You can use create-react-app or gatsby or any other starter template.
The api to use is the one you built in Question 2.
The requirements for this app are,
1. Display all fields from the api in your UI,
2. Have a “Next” button to fetch a new random beer and display data on the UI,
3. Initial render when there is no beer should show a loading icon,


## How to run
1. run command `yarn install`
2. run command `yarn start` to start application
3. access web browser `http://localhost:3000`
